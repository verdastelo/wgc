1. Basics: variables, consonants, arithmetic, control flow, functions and the 
   rudiments of input and output.
2. A C program consists of functions and variables. Functions contain 
   statements. Statements specify computing operations. Variables store
   values used during the computation.
3. C functions are like subroutines of Fortran and procedures of Pascal.
4. A function is called by naming it. It is followed by a parenthesised list
   of arguments. 
5. New ideas: comments, declarations, arithmetic expressions, loops and forma-
   tted output.
