// Program: Decimal to Binary Converter
// Author: Четан Ананд

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Converting from decimal to binary requires us to work with numbers. But we can't work with numbers
  // in vacuum. For that we'll need some space or variables.
  // The variables we're going to declare will be our storage spaces.
  int deci = 0; // will store the numbers in their decimal representation.
  // We can start with asking a user to enter a number and storing what he enters in " deci".
  cout << "Enter a number: ";
  cin >> deci;
  // Now, we've a number in its decimal representation. What can be done to convert the number into its
  // binary representation?
  //
