1. Modern computer architecture is based off of Von Neumann architecture
2. Von Neumann architecture divides the computer up into two parts: CPU
   and memory
3. The CPU reads instructions from memory one at a time and executes them. 
   This is called fetch-execute cycle.
4. The elements of the CPU: 
   a. Program counter
   b. Instruction decoder
   c. Data bus
   d. General-purpose register
   e. Arithmetic and logic unit
5. Address
6. Is there a difference between a value that's an address and a value
   that's an ASCII code?
7. How does the CPU recognise instructions and other data?
8. Two ways to store customer information in memory.
9. Data accessing methods:
   a. Immediate mode - data is embedded in the instruction
   b. Direct addressing mode - contains the address to load the data from
   c. Index addressing mode - index and multipliers
   d. Indirect addressing mode - contains a pointer to where the data should
                                 be loaded from
   e. Base-pointer offsetting mode
