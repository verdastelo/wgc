3. Why were BASIC interpreters slow? How Python's interpreters are different?
4. What is in-memory compilation?
5. C++ start compilation by running a preprocessor on the source code.
6. Terms: preprocessor, linker, peephole optimiser, type checking.
7. Type checking is of two types: (a) Static type checking and (b) Dynamic type checking.
8. What is a subroutine? 
9. How are declarations different from definitions?
10. Do C and C++ view int func1(); differently?
11. What does a variable declaration tell a compiler?
12. What is the role of extern in extern int a;? 
13. In the function declarations, the argument identifiers are optional. 
    In the definitions, they are required (the identifiers are required
    only in C, not C++). <--- CONFUSING 
14. Can you use libraries inherited from C in modern C++?
15. How C++ namespaces are an advantage of C in the implementation of large programs?
